# Installation

To run the server, you need to have node.js installed on your system. If you haven`t got it installed, go to https://nodejs.org and download version 8.9.3 LTS. To make sure that node.js is installed properly, run the command below in your terminal to see the node.js version:

node -v

All the needed packages are already in the project, so no other steps are needed.

# Running

To run the server, navigate your terminal to the folder where project is located. Then, to start the server, simply run the comman in your terminal:

node server.js

That's all, folks!
